## Requirements

- OS: 
    - The Hardstuck Rental application was developed using Windows 10. There are Netbeans versions available for Mac OS and Linux, however their stability is not guaranteed.
    - Other versions of Windows might also work, but their stability is not guaranteed.

- GPU:
    - A GPU should not be required, but it will be helpful.

- Memory:
    - Your computer should have at least 2GB of RAM.

- Software
    - Apache Neteans IDE 15
    - *Note: This project may not be compatible with older versions of Netbeans. Ensure that the correct Netbeans version is installed before proceeding. Newer versions may throw error messages, but the project should still work.*

Apache Netbeans is a very light-weight application framework, and should thus be able to run on most computers.
